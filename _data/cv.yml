    - title: Senior Algorithm Engineer
      institution: Ant Group
      year: 02/2023 - now
      description:
        - Trained 10B and 65B Ant Group self-innovated large language model (LLM). Supported supervised fine-tuning stage to improve LLM reasoning capability.
        - Lead to implement and maintain company-level LLM evaluation pipeline, which contained 50+ public/private datasets and 20+ evaluation metrics. It served as the default evaluation toolkit for all major Ant Group Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) teams. 
        - Implemented LLM agents to support two Ant Group internal human resource related use-cases, including meeting arrangements and hiring & dimission.
    - title: Applied Scientist
      institution: Amazon Alexa AI 
      year: 06/2020 - 01/2023
      description:
        - Built Natural Language Understanding (NLU) pipelines for Alexa to support customer utterance interpretation. 
        - Expanded Alexa NLU pipelines from English regions to other language regions by involving contextual signals.
        - Developed 3p skill recommendation for fall back utterances to improve customer experience. 
    - title: Data Scientist Intern
      institution: Amazon Alexa AI 
      year: 06/2019 - 09/2019
      description:
        - Applied deep language models and state-of-art clustering methods to extract infuential text patterns from user requests.
        - Built up an automatic pipeline by Spark and Shell scripts to enable training models on multiple data resources under Alexa restricted environment to replace existing human labor annotation.

    - title: NLP Research Intern
      institution: Alibaba DAMO Academy / AI Lab
      year: 02/2018 - 03/2019
      description:
        - Generated product review summary from user consecutive behaviors by leveraging dynamic matrix factorization, deep reinforcement learning (Policy Gradient) and sequence to sequence model (Neural Machine Translation) with Attention techniques.
        - Proposed an end-to-end pairwise ranking model with transfer learning techniques to detect communities in targeted sparse graphs.
        - Detected multilevel anomalies from high dimensional dynamic use logs via Adversarial Autoencoder and Attention-based hierarchical representation learning.
