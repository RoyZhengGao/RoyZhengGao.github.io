Hi, I am Zheng Gao, an Applied Scientist at [Amazon Alexa AI](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-ai). Currently I am working on Natural Language Understanding projects to support Alexa better understand millions of utterances in a daily basis. 

Before joining Alexa, I received my Ph.D. degree in Information Science and minor in Computer Science at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), advised by Prof. [Xiaozhong Liu](http://xiaozhong.website2.me/) in 2020. Besides, I finished my master degree at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) and bachelor degree at [Shanghai International Studies University](http://en.shisu.edu.cn/).  

My research interests are primarily in the area of **Graph Mining** and **Natural Language Processing** (NLP). Particularly, I am applying deep learning techniques on the interdisciplinary field therein them to solve Community Detection, Information Retrieval and Recommendation related tasks.
