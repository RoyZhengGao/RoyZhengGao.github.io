Hi, I am Zheng Gao, a senior algorithm engineer at [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en/home). Before I joined Ant Group, I was an applied scientist in [Amazon Alexa AI](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-ai).

I received my Ph.D. degree in Information Science and minor in Computer Science at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), advised by Prof. [Xiaozhong Liu](http://xiaozhong.website2.me/) in 2020. Besides, I finished my master degree at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) and bachelor degree at [Shanghai International Studies University](http://en.shisu.edu.cn/).  

 My full efforts are currently in building up **large language models** and seeking potential industrial values in LLM-based applications. I am training 10B/65B self-innovated large language models to improve their reasoning capability, implementing agent-based applications to serve company internal use-cases, and developing evaluation pipelines to better assess LLM performances.
