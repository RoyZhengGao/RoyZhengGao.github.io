Hi, I am Zheng Gao, a machine learning engineer at [Coupang](https://www.coupang.com/). Before I joined Coupang, I worked at [Amazon Alexa AI](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/amazon-ai) and [Ant Group](https://www.antgroup.com/en).

I received my Ph.D. degree in Information Science and minor in Computer Science at [Indiana University Bloomington](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html), advised by Prof. [Xiaozhong Liu](http://xiaozhong.website2.me/) in 2020. Besides, I finished my master degree at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/) and bachelor degree at [Shanghai International Studies University](http://en.shisu.edu.cn/).  

My research interests are primarily in the area of Graph Mining, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Model (LLM). Particularly, I am applying deep learning techniques on the interdisciplinary field therein them to solve LLM Agent, Information Retrieval and Recommendation tasks.
